# Optimizing Mannose Modulation in T Cell Immunotherapy
### Work in Progress
This is a personel project. This project develops a containerized bioinformatics workflow to analyze scCITE-seq data on mannose metabolism's role in T cell differentiation and anti-tumor immunity. It includes preprocessing, quality control, clustering, and pathway analysis. Hosted on Microsoft Azure, it leverages scalable infrastructure, Nextflow for workflow management, Docker/Singularity for reproducibility, and R for data analysis.
